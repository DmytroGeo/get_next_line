In gardens green where sunlight spillshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,
A world of wonder softly thrills.
The herbs arise with fragrant grace,
Each bearing gifts, a healing face.

Sweet basil sways with summer’s breeze,
Its leaves a balm for aches to ease.
Thyme whispers low in ancient tongue,
A tale of health when life was young.

Rosemary bold with piney zest,
Keeps memories sharp, a mind refreshed.
Lavender blooms in purple hue,
A calming scent, the soul renews.

Sage, the wise, with silver crest,
Brings wisdom’s light to hearts oppressed.
Mint dances wild, a cooling balm,
Its essence pure, a healer’s calm.

Cilantro’s tang, a vibrant spark,
In dishes bright, it leaves its mark.
Oregano, with strength so bold,
Defends the body, wards the cold.

From parsley’s green to dill’s fine lace,
Each herb finds purpose, earns its place.
In pot or soil, they weave their spell,
A fragrant symphony to quell.

So tend them well, these gifts of earth,
And cherish all their sacred worth.
The humble herbs, a treasure trove,
Of nature’s wisdom, life, and love.
